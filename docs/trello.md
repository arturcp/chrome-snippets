# Trello

I use [Trello](https://trello.com/) to organize my week, a slight variation of the to-do/doing/done classic columns of the Scrum, adapted to my needs.

In the Trello's folder you will find scripts that automate actions I perform in my weekly board.

- `prepare-for-the-week.js`: clean up the board to start a new week.
